Hi! My name is Wren, and I'm a Pittsburgh-native amateur astrophotographer. Nights of Wren is a personal site I'm creating as a platform to share my photos with others. My work to date is mostly *deep-sky astrophotography*, which means almost all of my targets are very distant things as opposed to planets. This category includes a wide variety of object types: ancient clusters of stars in orbit around the Milky Way, oceans of star-forming hydrogen lightyears across, remnants of dead or dying stars, galaxies far far away, and more. Several of these objects appear very large, spanning the area of several full moons on the night sky, but most are very dim, and require hours of exposure time distributed over dozens or hundreds of exposures to produce a low-noise image in a moderately light-polluted environment. These exposures are then edited (or individually thrown out) to remove sources of interference such as camera electronics, skyglow, or satellite trails, and {{<def "stacking">}}stacked{{</def>}} into one composite final image.

My current collection of equipment is as follows:
 - Camera: Fujifilm X-A5
 - Telescopes: GSO 6" F/4 Newtonian, Svbony SV165 Guide Scope
 - Mount: Celestron Advanced VX
 - Guide Scope: ZWO ASI120MM Mini
 - Lenses: GSO Coma Corrector
 - Software (Planets): FireCapture, PIPP, AutoStakkert! 3, and Registax 6
 - Software (DSOs): phd2, KStars/Ekos with a [self-written shutter release driver](https://github.com/wrenby/indi-serial-shutter-release/), Siril, DeepSkyStacker, StarNet++, and GIMP

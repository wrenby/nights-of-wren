My first successful attempt at planetary photography! It's not about to win an [APOD](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html), but basically no part of my equipment is well-suited for planetary work except this camera, so I'm extremely happy with the amount of detail that's visible. Even with through a monochrome camera depriving it of its signature color, being able to clearly make out the Great Red Spot is extremely cool :D

This final image is a sharpened {{<def stack />}} of the best 90% of 10,000 frames of video spanning about two minutes. Captured using a ZWO ASI120MM Mini and a GSO 6" F/4 Newtonian mounted on a Celestron AVX, and processed with AutoStakkert!3 and Registax 6.

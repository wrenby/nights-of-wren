Approximately 245 million lightyears in the direction of the constellation Andromeda, The Andromeda Galaxy (also known as {{<def M />}} 31 and {{<def NGC />}} 224, formerly the Great Spiral Nebula in Andromeda) is our closest neighboring galaxy of similar size, and is projected to merge with the Milky Way in 4-5 billion years. The Andromeda Galaxy played an important role in [The Great Debate](https://apod.nasa.gov/diamond_jubilee/debate20.html) concerning the size of the universe and the nature of spiral galaxies -- then called spiral nebulae or island universes, depending on your side of the argument. The debate was settled in 1925 after Edwin Hubble measured the distance to Andromeda using {{<def "Cepheid variable">}}Cepheid variable stars{{</def>}}, and determined it was far outside the range of the Milky Way.

Captured over two nights using a Fujifilm X-A5 and a GSO 6" F/4 Newtonian mounted on a Celestron AVX, and processed with Siril and GIMP. This image is a {{<def stack />}} of 5.5 hours total integration time distributed over 221 exposures at 1000 ISO, and calibrated using 40 biases, flats, and darks.

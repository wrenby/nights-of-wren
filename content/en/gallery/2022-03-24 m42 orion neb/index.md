Experienced astrophotographers often recommend rookies start with Orion, and for good reason. The entire constellation is veiled in a vast network of interstellar gas and dust known has the Orion Complex, which contains in its denser regions some of the most eye-catching stellar nurseries visible from Earth. One such stellar nursery is {{<def M />}} 42, the photogenic Orion Nebula: by far the brightest nebula in the northern hemisphere, visible to the naked eye even near a city. It can be found in the middle of the {{<def asterism />}} Orion's Sword, with its fuzzy appearance distinguishing it from the stars around it. It owes this fuzz to the nebulosity around the Trapezium Cluster, which scatters and reflects the star cluster's light -- mostly coming from the massive {{<def "binary star" />}} 41 Ori C. This same star cluster causes most of the pink glow visible in photos (due to hydrogen atoms absorbing some energy from incoming light and re-emitting it at a specific wavelength of red) and it also helps to illuminate the dimmer parts of the nebula.

Captured using a Fujifilm X-A5 and a GSO 6" F/4 Newtonian mounted on a Celestron AVX, processed with Siril and GIMP. This image is a {{<def stack />}} of 38x30s light frames taken at 1600 ISO. This was before I understood the importance of calibration frames, so none were used -- I simply cropped out the worst of the dust motes and vignetting.

The smaller next-door neighbor of the North America Nebula, the Pelican Nebula (also known as {{< def IC />}} 5067, {{< def LBN />}} 353, and {{< def Ced />}} 183a) is a {{< def "hydrogen alpha" />}} {{< def "emission nebula" />}} in the constellation Cygnus. Captured using a Fujifilm X-A5 and a GSO 6" F/4 Newtonian mounted on a Celestron AVX, processed with Siril and GIMP. This image is a {{<def stack />}} of 3 hours total integration time distributed over 120 exposures at 1000 ISO, and calibrated with 100 biases, 40 flats, and 40 darks.

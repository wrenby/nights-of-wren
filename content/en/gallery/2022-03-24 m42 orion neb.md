If you were to ask someone on the street what they know about the constellation Orion, they'd probably just mention the belt and keep walking. But if that someone happened to be an astronomer, they might be more inclined to start by talking about the Orion complex. The Orion complex is a vast network of interstellar gas and dust spanning the entire constellation, and home to the closest stellar nurseries to Earth. One such stellar nursery is {{<def M />}} 42, the photogenic Orion Nebula: by far the brightest nebula in the northern hemisphere, visible to the naked eye even near a city. It can be found in the middle of the {{<def asterism />}} Orion's Sword, with its fuzzy appearance distinguishing it from the stars around it. It owes this fuzz to the nebulosity around the Trapezium Cluster, which scatters and reflects the star cluster's light -- mostly coming from the massive {{<def "binary star" />}} 41 Ori C. This same star cluster causes most of the pink glow visible in photos, which is due to hydrogen atoms absorbing and re-emitting light at a specific wavelength of red, and it also helps to illuminate the dimmer parts of the nebula.

Captured using a Fujifilm X-A5 and a GSO 6" F/4 Newtonian mounted on a Celestron AVX, processed with Siril and GIMP. This image is a {{<def stack />}} of 38x30s light frames taken at 1600 ISO. This was before I understood the importance of calibration frames, so none were used -- I simply cropped out the worst of the dust motes and vignetting.

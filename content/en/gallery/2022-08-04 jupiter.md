My first successful attempt at planetary photography! My gear is very far from ideal for planetary work, so I was blown away with the amount of detail I managed to pull out of it. Even in low-res with a mono camera, being able to resolve enough surface detail to see the Great Red Spot is an absolute privilege.

I had my scope set up for the Triangulum Galaxy (coming soon, whenever the weather cooperates)
, and stayed outside until birdsong


The best 90% of a 10,000 frames of video, {{<def stack>}}stacked{{</def>}} with AutoStakkert!3 and sharpened with Registax 6.

, and a shitty $15 Barlow lens I got off Amazon.

Captured over two nights using a Fujifilm X-A5 and a GSO 6" F/4 mounted on a Celestron AVX, and processed with Siril and GIMP. This image is a {{<def stack />}} of 5.5 hours total integration time distributed over 221 exposures at 1000 ISO, and calibrated using 40 biases, flats, and darks.

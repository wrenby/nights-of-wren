Back before I had my trusty electronic focuser or the 3D-printed [Bahtinov mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahtinov_mask) I used before that, I used to warm up with some quick pictures of the moon to verify that I was in-focus, and that my telescope mount could find its targets with reasonable accuracy. I've always been happy with how this one turned out, so I thought I'd upload it as a mini behind the scenes.

Captured using a Fujifilm X-A5 and a GSO 6" F/4 Newtonian mounted on an untracked Celestron AVX. This image is a {{<def stack />}} of 25x1&frasl;640s light frames taken at 200 ISO. Processed with (1) Siril for stacking, calibration, and deconvolution, and (2) GIMP for the adjustments to brightness and contrast.

My first successful attempt at planetary photography! This was a tough job for my equipment, since my telescope is designed to be good at efficiently capturing long exposures of large dim objects like [diffuse nebulae](/tags/diffuse-nebula) and not high-resolution millisecond-scale exposures of small bright objects. That said, I get a kick out of using my equipment wrong, and I'm very pleased with the amount of detail that's visible. The Great Red Spot remains impressive even through a monochrome camera depriving it of its signature color.

This final image is a sharpened {{<def stack />}} of the best 90% of 10,000 frames of video spanning about two minutes. Captured using a ZWO ASI120MM Mini and a GSO 6" F/4 Newtonian mounted on a Celestron AVX, and processed with AutoStakkert!3 and Registax 6.

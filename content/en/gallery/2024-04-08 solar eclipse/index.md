is processed fairly heavy-handedly due to some. and my eclipse app started its 10 second countdown in what felt like complete silence. When totality arrived,  changing was the furthest thing from my mind. Instead of a few hundred variety of exposure times like I had planned, and ended up with just short of 3000 frames

 I plan on writing a piece of software to help with automation before my next attempt shooting an eclipse.

A trio of {{<def "interacting galaxies" />}} about 35 million {{<def "light year" />}}s{{% cite "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2002A%26A...389...19P/abstract" %}} towards the constellation Leo's hind leg, the Leo Triplet is a popular spring target for astrophotographers looking to fill a slightly wider field of view in a season that mostly caters to high-magnification telescopes. The group is gravitationally dominated by {{<def M />}} 66, the irregularly-shaped galaxy towards the top of frame, which was discovered along with M 65 by Charles Messier in 1780. {{<def NGC />}} 3628 was discovered by William Herschel in 1784.

One of the most well-known features of the Leo Triplet is NGC 3628's enormous tail extending to the top right, very faint in optical wavelengths but [visible here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...658A..25W/graphics) -- which may have been pulled out of it by gravitational interactions with one or both of the other two galaxies{{% cite "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022A%26A...658A..25W/abstract" %}}, or may be the remains of a not-quite-absorbed dwarf galaxy{{% cite "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...812L..10J/abstract" %}}. This plume hosts about 15% of the hydrogen content found in the galaxy itself{{% cite "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979ApJ...229...83H/abstract" %}} as well as a recently-discovered dwarf galaxy at its tip. If this dwarf galaxy was formed after a tidal interaction with another galaxy, as argued by its discoverers, it would be the closest to the Milky Way formed in this way.{{% cite "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...786..144N/abstract" %}}

Captured using a Fujifilm X-A5 and a GSO 6" F/4 Newtonian mounted on a Celestron AVX. This image is a {{<def stack />}} of 57x90s light frames at 1250 ISO, calibrated with 20 flats, 12 darks, and 20 bias frames. Processed with (1) Siril for pre-processing, stacking, background extraction, and a histogram stretch, and (2) GIMP for wavelet decomposition, tweaks to color grading, and decreasing background intensity.

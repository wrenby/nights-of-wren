{{<def M />}} The Pinwheel Galaxy

The Pinwheel Galaxy has the historically interesting detail of having possibly having been assigned two separate {{<def M>Messier</def>}} numbers! Although some evidence points to M 102 actually being NGC 5866, its original discoverer later became convinced that he had been mistaken, and wrote a letter retracting his discovery.
